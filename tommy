the monster wants tommy to pick some fruits for the monster to eat
the monster gave tommy some post-it notes to write down the number
of each fruits to buy. you can write down a number on a post-it note
using the <- statement

apples <- 3

this writes down the number three on a post-it note with the label apple
you can examine the number on this post-it note later by using the examine
statement

apples <- 4
exaimne apples

the monster wants 3 apples and 4 bananas, write these down on post-it notes
so little tommy can remember latter






each time little tommy feeds the monster a fruit, he should update the post-it
notes for that fruit, he can do this using the <- statements

apples <- apples - 1

this says, examine the current number written on the apples post-it note, 
erase what is written on the apples post-it note, then write down the number
minus one



the monster told tommy it wants to eat 100
